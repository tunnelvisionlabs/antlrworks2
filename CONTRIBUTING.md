## Contributor Agreement (required for pull requests)

While the ANTLRWorks 2 project is open source under the LGPL license, contributions
back to this project which contain code must be made available to Tunnel Vision
Laboratories, LLC under the terms of the MIT license.

### What does this mean?

This means Tunnel Vision Laboratories, LLC can do the following with code contributed
back to the project from the open source community.

1. Include the code in future ANTLRWorks 2 releases.
2. Include the code, in original or modified form, in other products created by Tunnel
   Vision Labs, **including closed-source products**.

### How do I agree to these terms?

To agree to these terms, sign the contributing agreement in `CONTRIBUTORS.md` and
include the change as a commit with your pull request. **Pull requests which contain
commits from users not explicitly listed in the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file will be
rejected *without review*.**

* You only need to sign the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file prior to the first time you
  submit a pull request (or include it as part of the pull request itself).
* The submitter of a pull request which adds a user to the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file
  *must* match the user information which was added to the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file.
  For example, only @sharwell can send a pull request containing a commit which adds
  @sharwell to the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file.
